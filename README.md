# IGARD-INTELLIGENT-AIoT-SMART-GARDEN-ROBOT

This project was created to provide gardeners the ability to compute and comprehend environmental indicators. Hardware includes an Android phone, an Arduino Uno microcontroller, two 3.7-volt 13000mA lead Li-Ion batteries linked in series, an ESP32 camera module, an extension board V5, a pH sensor, a soil moisture sensor, a Bluetooth module, a robot tyre, a servo motor, a DC motor, and a driver motor. The systems can be used with an Android phone that has the IGARD app downloaded. MIT App Inventor was used to create the IGARD Application. Bluetooth was set as a controller to operate the IGARDRobot. This paper demonstrates how, using an Arduino Uno and wireless technology, we can observe circuit diagrams and display the results using the IGARD App. IGARDRobot is equipped with a camera and sends the data to mobile phones through Bluetooth network. The robot has portable sprinkler and servo motor for watering the farm. It works with humidity and pH sensors. The highlighting features of this project include real-time image sharing and sensors for measuring moisture and pH of the soil. A message is sent between Arduino Uno and IGARD App when it detects low moisture and warm temperature, or when the soil is too acidic or alkaline, and it manually begins the motor operated by the gardener/farmer in home gardening, farm, etc.
